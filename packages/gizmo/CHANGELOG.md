# @unional/gizmo

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- d0a68ba: Initial release.

  In this release, the basic functionality are working,
  except that dynamic dependencies are treated as static dependencies.

  This means the required dynamic dependencies need to be provided before adding the dependent gizmo.
